## Build A Laravel App With TDD

It's time to take the techniques we learned in [Laravel From Scratch](http://laravelfromscratch.com/), and put them to good use building your first real-world application. Together, we'll leverage TDD to create Birdboard: a minimal Basecamp-like project management app.

This series will give us a wide range of opportunities to pull up our sleeves and test our Laravel chops. As always, we start from scratch: laravel new birdboard.
